## Implementation Details

### Login Page Enhancements
```css
/* Animated background blobs */
.animate-blob {
  animation: blob 7s infinite;
}

/* Glass morphism cards */
.backdrop-blur-sm {
  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
}

/* Gradient backgrounds */
.bg-gradient-to-br {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, ...);
}
```
