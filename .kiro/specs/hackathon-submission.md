# Code with Kiro Hackathon Submission

## Project: DevFlow AI
**Category**: Productivity & Workflow Tools

## How Kiro Was Used

### 1. Conversational Development & Design
- Used Kiro's chat interface to brainstorm the DevFlow AI concept
- Structured conversations around developer pain points and workflow automation
- Iteratively refined features through natural language discussions
- **UI/UX Design**: Collaborated with Kiro to create modern design system with gradients and animations
- **Most Impressive Code Generation**: Kiro generated complete UI transformation including:
  - Gradient background system with animated floating blobs
  - Glass-morphism effects with backdrop blur CSS
  - Responsive theming for dark/light modes
  - Professional purple-pink-blue color scheme
  - Complete GitHub OAuth authentication flow

### 2. Spec-Driven Development
- Created detailed specifications in `.kiro/specs/` for major features
- Used specs to guide implementation and ensure comprehensive coverage
- Leveraged Kiro's understanding of specs to generate consistent code

### 3. Agent Hooks for Automation
- **Test and Lint Hook**: Automatically runs tests and linting on file save
- **Documentation Hook**: Updates README and docs when features are added
- Improved development velocity by automating repetitive tasks

### 4. Steering for Consistency
- Project context steering ensures consistent architecture decisions
- Development workflow steering maintains code quality standards
- Kiro uses steering to understand project conventions and patterns
